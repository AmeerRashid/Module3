It took me a bit to figure out the TWINE interface because when we did the donut challenge I was on research and didn't really use it. I used TWINE online and read the cookbook which was pretty much the same as using markdown so that was nothing new. I had to figure out how to link the passages to each other because I didn't know I had to double-click to link it to an existing passage so it would create a new tile with the same name each time. Then I had to transfer everything I wrote to the newly created one. I messed with that for a bit then I double-clicked the little pop-up and it linked it so then it was smooth sailing. 

I had a little trouble putting the 3D model into the story. I checked Sketchfab and found the 'embed' link which gives you a link to copy which embeds your model into whatever you want. 

I wasn't sure if the link to play the game was working or not so I emailed it to my sister and she let me know that it works.
