The lecture we had on March 12, 2018 about archaeogaming with the Skype call from Andrew Reinhard was very interesting and he helped reinforce the things we talked about in class. I liked that he discussed the things we do without realizing we do them. He talked about hearing a gun sound in a game and knowing exactly which gun it is even without seeing it. I didn't know I knew that until he said it. It's automatic and having played games for years I have that knowledge ingrained in my head. 

I also found it interesting how he goes into games to study them. To see how the mechanics, world, and game population interact together with the player to create a unique experience. He said he has a set of rules that outline how he has to behave regarding ethics, it's just something I would have never thought about while gaming and now I'll end up approaching things a little differently now.
