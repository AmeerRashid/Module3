For Module 3, I chose to make a TWINE game. I wasn't sure how to relate the story to my model from Module 1, but since it was my choice I decided to make the story about the life of Saint Thomas Aquinas. His life isn't exactly the most interesting, but there were a few years when he was in university that are mentionable. He was essentially kidnapped by his family and kept prisoner for a year which I thought might make a decent story/game. My choice to make this my game is reflective of the things we talked about in class regarding archeaological gaming. I opted for the version that I deemed more interesting to an audience rather than the historically accurate version. 

Juan Hiriart falls for the same trap while discussing his game in his article *Surviving The Middle Ages: Notes on Crafting Gameplay For a Digital Historical Game.* He describes researching for his game and the sources he looked at to get the information he needed to develop a historically accurate world and NPCs. After explaining his process he says, "It needed to be engaging and fun, setting into motion all the mechanisms that make games intrinsically motivating." (Hiriart, 2016) Historians and game developers alike imagine that they need to create a captivating game for their audience instead of letting the history speak for itself. I guess what I mean to say is that I am part of the problem.
